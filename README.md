w3c_validator is a Puppet module that builds a working markup validator, preferably on Centos 6+.

Note this module is dependant on meltwater/cpan puppet module - so do a "puppet module install meltwater-cpan" before you 
start. 

This summer,  w3c_validator is also coming to a Puppet Forge near you.
